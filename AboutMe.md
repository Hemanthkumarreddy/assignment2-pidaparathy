# Hemanth Kumar Reddy Pidaparathy

I'm Hemanth Kumar Reddy Pidaparathy, you can call me by Hemanth. I am a person who is upbeat in all aspects of life. I enjoy doing, seeing, and experiencing new things. I enjoy reading and writing; I enjoy thinking and dreaming; I enjoy talking and listening. I enjoy watching the sunrise in the morning and the moonlight at night; I enjoy feeling the music on my face and smelling the wind from the ocean.
