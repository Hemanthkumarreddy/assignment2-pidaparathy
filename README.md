<h6>Kerala</h6>
<p>Kerala is referred to as "<b>God's Own Country</b>." Keralites are extremely friendly and will welcome you with open arms to their region! Coconuts are a staple for food, skin and hair, and a variety of other uses in Kerala, which is known as the land of palm trees. So far, one of my favorite dishes has been the Putta (coconut rice) with squashed bananas, which is a popular breakfast option. A popular dessert is Palada Payasam, which is made with rice ada, milk, sugar, and ghee. A banana leaf is used to serve a traditional Kerala meal. The scenery is stunning, and the environment is spotless! Traveling through Kerala is like walking into a tropical paradise for me because I love nature. You can expect palm trees, beautiful beaches, and wild animals. The state of Kerala is well-known for its tea plantations. I highly recommend a trip to Munnar's tea plantations. This region's rolling hills will make you never want to leave Kerala â€“ everything is green!</p>
