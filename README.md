###### Kerala
**Kerala** is referred to as "**God's Own Country**." one of my favorite dishes has been the **Putta (coconut rice)** with squashed bananas, which is a popular breakfast option. A **banana leaf** is used to serve a **traditional Kerala meal**. The scenery is stunning, and the environment is spotless! Traveling through Kerala is like walking into a tropical paradise for me because **I love nature**. I highly recommend a trip to Munnar's tea plantations. This region's rolling hills will make you never want to leave Kerala â€“ **everything is green**!
